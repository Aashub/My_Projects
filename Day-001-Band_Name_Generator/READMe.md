# Day 1 - Band Name Generator

## What I Learned
- **Printing and Input:** Learned how to print to the console and take user input.
- **String Manipulation:** Practiced concatenating strings to create a band name.
- **Variables:** Used variables to store user input and manipulate them.

## Project Overview
The Band Name Generator takes the user's input for their city and pet name to generate a unique band name.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user for their city name and their pet's name.
- It concatenates these inputs to create a band name in the format: "CityName PetName".

## Code Highlights
- Using `input()` to capture user input
- Simple string concatenation to create the band name
