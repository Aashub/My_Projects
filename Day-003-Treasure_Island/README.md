# Day 3 - Treasure Island Adventure

## What I Learned
- **Conditional Statements:** Used `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of the game based on user choices.
- **Logic and Scope:** Managed game state and responses based on user input.

## Project Overview
The Treasure Island Adventure is an interactive text-based game where the player makes choices to navigate through an island and find treasure.

## How It Works
- The game prompts the user to make decisions that affect the outcome.
- Based on the choices, players can reach different endings (winning or losing).

## Code Highlights
- Implementing a series of `if` statements to determine game outcomes
- Collecting user input to guide the story
