# Day 4 - Rock Paper Scissors Game

## What I Learned
- **Lists:** Created lists to store options for the game.
- **Random Module:** Used `random` to simulate the computer's choice.
- **Game Logic:** Implemented the rules for winning and losing in the game.

## Project Overview
The Rock Paper Scissors Game allows the user to play against the computer, which randomly selects an option.

## How It Works
- The player inputs their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
- The computer randomly selects an option, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## Code Highlights
- Using `random.choice()` to simulate computer choice
- Structuring the game logic with conditional statements
