## What I Learned
- **Data Types and Type Conversion:** Explored different data types and how to convert between them.
- **Mathematical Operations:** Performed arithmetic operations to calculate totals and splits.
- **Formatted Strings:** Used f-strings for cleaner output formatting.

## Project Overview
The Bill Split Calculator calculates how much each person owes based on the total bill and the number of people splitting it, including an optional tip percentage.

## How It Works
- The program takes inputs for the total bill, number of people, and tip percentage.
- It calculates the total amount with tip and divides it by the number of people.

## Code Highlights
- Using `input()` for capturing numeric values
- Performing calculations for totals and splits
